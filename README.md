# Preface 
- The fact that regular check-ups are important to us makes Medical Clinics really important everywhere. That’s why it’s crucial to always have a neat system that organizes the patients data in a way that assures PHI “Protected Health Information” which is referred to medical records, results and other data a healthcare professional collects for medical purposes. Generally speaking, that  means programmers and technology experts should always be in the fit level to provide the good system for medical purposes because nowadays  digitizing the PHI with appropriate privacy hierarchy became essential for both the privacy of patients and the ethical behavior of any medical job. As I’m already working in the medical field I’ve got a glimpse of how these apps operate and work in the workflow of any medical system especially in the Medical Laboratories and how the results and examinations being held between lab technologist, patient and the doctor (if present).  
- This project will be a web app for a small medical center. It has an appointment system, medical record, different users with specific permissions for each. Patients can order an appointment and Doctors can manage both medical records and appointments.
